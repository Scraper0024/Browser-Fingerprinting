# Browser-Fingerprinting

Browser fingerprinting is the foundation for building device intelligence, enabling businesses to uniquely identify website visitors on websites around the world.

Just as your physical fingerprint is an absolutely unique combination of loops, whorls, and arches, the web browser you use to connect to websites also leaves a unique impression. However, instead of double loops and tent-shaped arches, browsers have personal markers such as screen resolution, stored WebGL, and graphics card configuration.

What is browser fingerprinting and how does it detect your device and block bot activity?
Reading this article and figuring them out now.

## What is Browser Fingerprinting?
Browser fingerprinting is a set of tools and technologies that can capture data through the browsing activities of web users. Websites collect various information about you, such as user operating system, browser type, screen resolution, time zone, keyboard layout, etc., and this process is usually done without your knowledge. By processing these details, it creates a unique identifier or "digital fingerprint" for each user.

Browser fingerprinting looks a bit similar to cookies. But they are different in that fingerprinting does not require user consent and there is no "opt-out" function, which you can basically see when you first visit a website with cookies.

### Which data will be collected?
Browser fingerprinting tools collect user data related to the user's software and hardware configuration, including:
| | |
| - | - |
| ✅ System fonts| ✅ Whether cookies are enabled|
| ✅ Operating system | ✅ OS language |
| ✅ Platform | ✅ HTTP header attributes |
| ✅ Keyboard layout | ✅ Web browser extensions used |
| ✅ Tor browser or not | ✅ Audio context analysis |
| ✅ Secure browser or not | ✅ CPU class |
| ✅ User agent | ✅ HTML 5 canvas fingerprinting(canvas size) |
| ✅ Browser local databases | ✅ Touch support |
| ✅ Navigator properties | ✅ Sensors such as accelerator, proximity, and gyroscope |


### How was I discovered?
If you're being tracked or identified, it's likely that your browser configuration, plugins, or lack of adequate privacy measures have made your fingerprint stand out. Fingerprints are especially effective for users:
- Rely on unique browser configurations.
- Use highly customized or outdated browsers.
- Fail to block JavaScript or Canvas data collection.

To avoid detection, consider privacy-focused browsers, tools like anti-detect browser solutions, disabling unnecessary plugins, or leveraging browser features that obfuscate fingerprint data.

## How does Browser Fingerprinting work?
1️⃣ **Step 1. Data Collection**

Websites collect user browser and device information through JavaScript or other technologies, including browser type, operating system, screen resolution, language settings, fonts, hardware information (such as GPU), and Canvas/WebGL rendering output.

2️⃣ **Step 2. Combined attributes**

The collected multiple attributes are integrated into a data set, which can maintain sufficient uniqueness even if some attributes change (such as browser upgrades).

3️⃣ **Step 3. Generate a unique identifier**
By processing these data sets (such as hash calculations), a unique fingerprint is generated to identify the user's device and browser.

4️⃣ **Step 4. Cross-session and website tracking**

Websites use the generated fingerprints to track users, and can still identify the same user even if the user clears cookies or enables privacy mode.

## 7 Browser Fingerprinting Techniques
### 1. Canvas fingerprinting
Canvas fingerprinting analyzes differences in the GPU and graphics driver of the user's device through the HTML5 canvas element. The script draws an image and captures the browser's rendering results. Differences in device hardware result in slightly different renderings, and these characteristics are converted into a unique "canvas fingerprint".

### 2. WebGL fingerprinting
This technology uses WebGL to generate 3D graphics in the user's browser and generates a unique identifier for the device by analyzing subtle differences in the generated graphics (caused by the GPU and driver). It relies on a combination of device hardware and drivers to accurately distinguish users.

### 3. Media device fingerprinting
Media device fingerprinting generates fingerprints by identifying media hardware and connected devices on the user's device. Although users are required to authorize camera or microphone access, it is very useful for services that rely on media devices (such as video calls).

### 4. TLS fingerprinting
TLS fingerprinting identifies devices by analyzing the combination of encryption algorithms used by devices and servers when establishing secure communications. This method uses details in the TLS handshake to generate a unique device fingerprint.

### 5. Font Fingerprinting
This technology uses the unique set of fonts installed on the user's device to generate a fingerprint. By detecting font differences in the user's system, the website can distinguish between user devices. This method is particularly effective for personalized content delivery and user identification.

### 6. Mobile Device Fingerprinting
Mobile device fingerprinting uses data such as operating system and screen resolution to create a unique profile of the device. It helps platforms identify returning users and detect abnormal device behavior and is an important tool for optimizing user experience and preventing fraud.

### 7. Audio Fingerprinting
Audio fingerprinting identifies users by capturing tiny hardware and software differences in how devices generate and process audio. This technology is widely used in digital rights management and personalized audio content delivery.

## Why were my fingerprints collected?
1. **Fraud detection**. Fingerprinting provides early warning indicators for sites that may be subject to high levels of fraud.
2. **Account creation and recovery**. Fingerprinting prevents the same user from generating/creating too many accounts. This prevents spam on their site and provides greater protection. In addition to this, matching fingerprints is a very useful tool for verifying the existence of users who need to recover their accounts after forgetting their login information.
3. **Content personalization**. Content personalization is closely related to fingerprinting. Advertisements and web page personalization can be built based on your usage history, guiding you to find things that you think you want to see, hear, or even buy.

## Cookies & Browser Fingerprinting: specific differences
Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on your device to remember information about your visit. They are transparent and easy to manage, allowing users to view, delete, or block them through browser settings. However, fingerprints are completely passive. They silently collect data without being stored on your device or having any direct interaction with you.
The following content can help you clearly see their differences:

| Feature        | Cookies                                                                 | Fingerprint                                                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Persistence**    | Temporary; may expire or be manually deleted.                          | Long-term: Based on rarely changing hardware, software, and behavioral data.     |
| **Transparency**   | Requires user consent; users can view, delete, or block cookies.       | Operates silently, often without user awareness or opt-out options.             |
| **Tracking**      | Stored on the user's device, typically requires explicit consent.      | Passive data collection without user consent.                                   |
| **Scope**          | Limited to specific websites unless explicitly shared.                 | Tracks users across websites, sessions, devices, and even different networks.   |
| **Avoidance Difficulty** | Easily blocked or managed using browser settings or extensions.  | Requires advanced measures, such as anti-detect browsers or specialized tools.  |
| **Disclosure**     | Disclosed via banners and privacy policies.                            | Rarely disclosed, making it difficult for users to know when fingerprinting occurs. |

## The Bottom Line
Browser fingerprinting has become a powerful but controversial tool in online tracking, combining complex technology with deep privacy issues. Unlike using cookies, fingerprinting passively collects data and resists traditional privacy defenses such as "invisibility", making it a frequent and somewhat invasive tracking method.
